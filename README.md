# Turn-based-Strategy-App
Make your way through a horde of monsters in this turn-based strategy game. Uses oriented programming to create templates for app's assets.

## Prerequisites
Either:
* A compiler such as Git Bash or Python 3+ Shell for compiling game.py
* trinket.io for in-browser compiler

Also:
* Pip3
* Python 3.52+ - the project was worked on using Python 3.6.1

## Original Contributions
* Character now has an inventory of items they can use for regeneration purposes or otherwise, as an additional option outside of resting.
* Enemies now have randomized names to go along with their descriptors.
* Index.html added to hold Trinket.io as an in-browser compiler.
* Added clear screen python file that gets called on to clear the screen, prevents compiler from scrolling down.

## Acknowledgements
* Used Treehouse's tutorial 'Object Oriented Python' to start app
